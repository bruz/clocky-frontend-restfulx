== Clocky RestfulX Frontend

Clocky is a trivial web application that is being implemented using different client-side 
frameworks. This is the RestfulX[http://restfulx.github.com implementation. It requires 
the {Clocky Rails Backend}[http://github.com/bruz/clocky-backend-rails.git].

=== Running the Clocky RestfulX Frontend

Install the {Clocky Rails Backend}[http://github.com/bruz/clocky-backend-rails.git] as 
described at http://github.com/bruz/clocky-backend-rails/blob/master/README.rdoc.
Make sure to run it on port 3000 (the Rails default) as that's what the RestfulX app will expect.

Make sure you have the following prerequisites:
- Ruby
- RubyGems
- The sinatra RubyGem (which will install additional gem dependencies)

Once those are in place, simply do:

  ruby server.rb

You should now be able to browse to http://localhost:4567 and see the application.
